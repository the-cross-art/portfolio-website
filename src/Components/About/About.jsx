            <p>
              I am an adept IT professional specializing in the development and
              debugging of web servers, APIs, libraries, and tools using
              JavaScript. Over the past two years, my career trajectory has
              evolved, providing me with a rich tapestry of experiences that
              have enhanced my skills and broadened my perspective.
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey began as a Full-stack Developer Intern at Web Cannon-Z,
              where I seamlessly collaborated with development teams to create
              applications for both mobile and web platforms. This experience
              not only solidified my coding prowess but also underscored the
              importance of effective teamwork and task delegation for overall
              project efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              Motivated by a passion for data and a desire to merge my software
              development acumen, I transitioned to the role of a Data Engineer
              Intern at Optum. In this role, I orchestrated the coordination of
              Data Science and Data Engineering Operations, resulting in the
              implementation of CI/CD pipelines that significantly improved
              software design, debugging, and release processes by 20%.
              Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the MLOps team, leading
              initiatives to enhance end-to-end model lifecycles and developer
              experience. Noteworthy achievements include successfully
              orchestrating the gradual transition of our team's AWS
              infrastructure to a modular and meticulously tested Infrastructure
              as Code (IaC) paradigm using Terraform. I also designed
              infrastructure CI pipelines utilizing Github Actions to automate
              Airflow-based infrastructure alterations.
            </p>
            <p>
              My problem-solving approach is rooted in astute critical thinking,
              adept time management, and refined communication competencies.
              Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered substantive
              contributions, instigating positive transformations in my previous
              roles. As a collaborative team player at heart, I am always eager
              to share insightful perspectives and contribute to steering
              consequential outcomes. For the back-end I also work with
              Javascript (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, etc). But, of course,
              whenever the project requires Django, I do Django as well .
